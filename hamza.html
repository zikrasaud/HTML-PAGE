<p>
I am having a teddy bear which could move, talk and smile. That teddy bear is you cutee!
I never liked the idea that babies grow up one day. That’s why no matter how older you get; 
I always like to think that you are still my baby brother.
You are the cutest brother in this world. Always were and always will be!
